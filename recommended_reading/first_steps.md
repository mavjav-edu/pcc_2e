# First Steps

There are a few resources right here that you might find helpful, if you haven't already become familiar with them:

- Cheat Sheets
  - When you're working on your own projects or working through another learning resoource, this [series of cheat sheets](../../cheat_sheets/cheat_sheets/) can save you from flipping through the book to brush up on syntax and concepts you're still working to solidify.
- Challenges
  - The exercises in the book are pretty basic; they're meant to keep people from just nodding along and saying, "I get that." I'm slowly building up a [set of more challenging exericses](../../challenges/challenges/) to push people further in using what's covered in the book. Check out these challenges, and see if you find any of them interesting.
- Finding Employment
  - Another question I get asked a lot is, "How do I find a job as a programmer?" That's a hard question because there are so many different kinds of work you can do as a programmer, and because the job field is a complicated area. You might be interested in [looking through this section](../../finding_employment/).
