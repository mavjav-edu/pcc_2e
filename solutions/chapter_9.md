## 9-1: Restaurant

Make a class called `Restaurant`. The `__init__()` method for `Restaurant` should store two attributes: a `restaurant_name` and a `cuisine_type`. Make a method called `describe_restaurant()` that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called `open_restaurant()` that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called `restaurant` from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = f"{self.name} serves wonderful {self.cuisine_type}."
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = f"{self.name} is open. Come on in!"
        print(f"\n{msg}")

restaurant = Restaurant('the mean queen', 'pizza')
print(restaurant.name)
print(restaurant.cuisine_type)

restaurant.describe_restaurant()
restaurant.open_restaurant()
```

Output:

```
The Mean Queen
pizza

The Mean Queen serves wonderful pizza.

The Mean Queen is open. Come on in!
```

## 9-2: Three Restaurants

Start with your class from Exercise 9-1. Create three different instances from the class, and call `describe_restaurant()` for each instance.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = f"{self.name} serves wonderful {self.cuisine_type}."
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = f"{self.name} is open. Come on in!"
        print(f"\n{msg}")

mean_queen = Restaurant('the mean queen', 'pizza')
mean_queen.describe_restaurant()

ludvigs = Restaurant("ludvig's bistro", 'seafood')
ludvigs.describe_restaurant()

mango_thai = Restaurant('mango thai', 'thai food')
mango_thai.describe_restaurant()
```

Output:

```
The Mean Queen serves wonderful pizza.

Ludvig'S Bistro serves wonderful seafood.

Mango Thai serves wonderful thai food.
```

## 9-3: Users

Make a class called `User`. Create two attributes called `first_name` and `last_name`, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called `describe_user()` that prints a summary of the user's information. Make another method called `greet_user()` that prints a personalized greeting to the user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()

    def describe_user(self):
        """Display a summary of the user's information."""
        print(f"\n{self.first_name} {self.last_name}")
        print(f"  Username: {self.username}")
        print(f"  Email: {self.email}")
        print(f"  Location: {self.location}")

    def greet_user(self):
        """Display a personalized greeting to the user."""
        print(f"\nWelcome back, {self.username}!")

eric = User('eric', 'matthes', 'e_matthes', 'e_matthes@example.com', 'alaska')
eric.describe_user()
eric.greet_user()

willie = User('willie', 'burger', 'willieburger', 'wb@example.com', 'alaska')
willie.describe_user()
willie.greet_user()
```

Output:

```
Eric Matthes
  Username: e_matthes
  Email: e_matthes@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Welcome back, e_matthes!

Willie Burger
  Username: willieburger
  Email: wb@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Welcome back, willieburger!
```

## 9-4: Number Served

Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 166). Add an attribute called `number_served` with a default value of 0. Create an instance called `restaurant` from this class. Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

Add a method called `set_number_served()` that lets you set the number of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print the value again.

Add a method called `increment_number_served()` that lets you increment the number of customers who've been served. Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type
        self.number_served = 0

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = f"{self.name} serves wonderful {self.cuisine_type}."
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = f"{self.name} is open. Come on in!"
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def set_number_served(self, number_served):
        """Allow user to set the number of customers that have been served."""
        self.number_served = number_served

    def increment_number_served(self, additional_served):
        """Allow user to increment the number of customers served."""
        self.number_served += additional_served


restaurant = Restaurant('the mean queen', 'pizza')
restaurant.describe_restaurant()

print(f"\nNumber served: {restaurant.number_served}")
restaurant.number_served = 430
print(f"Number served: {restaurant.number_served}")

restaurant.set_number_served(1257)
print(f"Number served: {restaurant.number_served}")

restaurant.increment_number_served(239)
print(f"Number served: {restaurant.number_served}")
```

Output:

```
The Mean Queen serves wonderful pizza.

Number served: 0
Number served: 430
Number served: 1257
Number served: 1496
```

## 9-5: Login Attempts

Add an attribute called `login_attempts` to your `User` class from Exercise 9-3 (page 166). Write a method called `increment_login_attempts()` that increments the value of `login_attempts` by 1. Write another method called `reset_login_attempts()` that resets the value of `login_attempts` to 0.

Make an instance of the `User` class and call `increment_login_attempts()` several times. Print the value of `login_attempts` to make sure it was incremented properly, and then call `reset_login_attempts()`. Print `login_attempts` again to make sure it was reset to 0.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()
        self.login_attempts = 0

    def describe_user(self):
        """Display a summary of the user's information."""
        print(f"\n{self.first_name} {self.last_name}")
        print(f"  Username: {self.username}")
        print(f"  Email: {self.email}")
        print(f"  Location: {self.location}")

    def greet_user(self):
        """Display a personalized greeting to the user."""
        print(f"\nWelcome back, {self.username}!")

    def increment_login_attempts(self):
        """Increment the value of login_attempts."""
        self.login_attempts += 1

    def reset_login_attempts(self):
        """Reset login_attempts to 0."""
        self.login_attempts = 0

eric = User('eric', 'matthes', 'e_matthes', 'e_matthes@example.com', 'alaska')
eric.describe_user()
eric.greet_user()

print("\nMaking 3 login attempts...")
eric.increment_login_attempts()
eric.increment_login_attempts()
eric.increment_login_attempts()
print(f"  Login attempts: {eric.login_attempts}")

print("Resetting login attempts...")
eric.reset_login_attempts()
print(f"  Login attempts: {eric.login_attempts}")
```

Output:

```
Eric Matthes
  Username: e_matthes
  Email: e_matthes@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Welcome back, e_matthes!

Making 3 login attempts...
  Login attempts: 3
Resetting login attempts...
  Login attempts: 0
```

## 9-6: Ice Cream Stand

An ice cream stand is a specific kind of restaurant. Write a class called `IceCreamStand` that inherits from the `Restaurant` class you wrote in Exercise 9-1 (page 166) or Exercise 9-4 (page 171). Either version of the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called `flavors` that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays theese flavors. Create an instance of `IceCreamStand`, and call this method.

```python
class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type
        self.number_served = 0

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = f"{self.name} serves wonderful {self.cuisine_type}."
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = f"{self.name} is open. Come on in!"
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def set_number_served(self, number_served):
        """Allow user to set the number of customers that have been served."""
        self.number_served = number_served

    def increment_number_served(self, additional_served):
        """Allow user to increment the number of customers served."""
        self.number_served += additional_served


class IceCreamStand(Restaurant):
    """Represent an ice cream stand."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type='ice_cream'):
        """Initialize an ice cream stand."""
        super().__init__(name, cuisine_type)
        self.flavors = []

    def show_flavors(self):
        """Display the flavors available."""
        print("\nWe have the following flavors available:")
        for flavor in self.flavors:
            print(f"- {flavor.title()}")


big_one = IceCreamStand('The Big One')
big_one.flavors = ['vanilla', 'chocolate', 'black cherry']

big_one.describe_restaurant()
big_one.show_flavors()
```

Output:

```
The Big One serves wonderful ice_cream.

We have the following flavors available:
- Vanilla
- Chocolate
- Black Cherry
```

## 9-7: Admin

An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called `Admin` that inherits from the `User` class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 166) or Exercise 9-5 (page 171). Add an attribute, `privileges`, that stores a list of strings like `"can add post"`, `"can delete post"`, `"can ban user"`, and so on. WRite a method called `show_privileges()` that lists the administrator's set of privileges. Create an instance of `Admin`, and call your method.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()
        self.login_attempts = 0

    def describe_user(self):
        """Display a summary of the user's information."""
        print(f"\n{self.first_name} {self.last_name}")
        print(f"  Username: {self.username}")
        print(f"  Email: {self.email}")
        print(f"  Location: {self.location}")

    def greet_user(self):
        """Display a personalized greeting to the user."""
        print(f"\nWelcome back, {self.username}!")

    def increment_login_attempts(self):
        """Increment the value of login_attempts."""
        self.login_attempts += 1

    def reset_login_attempts(self):
        """Reset login_attempts to 0."""
        self.login_attempts = 0


class Admin(User):
    """A user with administrative privileges."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the admin."""
        super().__init__(first_name, last_name, username, email, location)
        self.privileges = []

    def show_privileges(self):
        """Display the privileges this administrator has."""
        print("\nPrivileges:")
        for privilege in self.privileges:
            print(f"- {privilege}")


eric = Admin('eric', 'matthes', 'e_matthes', 'e_matthes@example.com', 'alaska')
eric.describe_user()

eric.privileges = [
    'can reset passwords',
    'can moderate discussions',
    'can suspend accounts',
    ]

eric.show_privileges()
```

Output:

```
Eric Matthes
  Username: e_matthes
  Email: e_matthes@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Privileges:
- can reset passwords
- can moderate discussions
- can suspend accounts
```

[top](#top)

## 9-8: Privileges

Write a separate `Privileges` class. The class should have one attribute, `privileges`, that stores a list of strings as described in Exercise 9-7. Move the `show_privileges()` method to this class. Make a `Privileges` instance as an attribute in the `Admin` class. Create a new instance of `Admin` and use your method to show its privileges.

```python
class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""
        self.first_name = first_name.title()
        self.last_name = last_name.title()
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.location = location.title()
        self.login_attempts = 0

    def describe_user(self):
        """Display a summary of the user's information."""
        print(f"\n{self.first_name} {self.last_name}")
        print(f"  Username: {self.username}")
        print(f"  Email: {self.email}")
        print(f"  Location: {self.location}")

    def greet_user(self):
        """Display a personalized greeting to the user."""
        print(f"\nWelcome back, {self.username}!")

    def increment_login_attempts(self):
        """Increment the value of login_attempts."""
        self.login_attempts += 1

    def reset_login_attempts(self):
        """Reset login_attempts to 0."""
        self.login_attempts = 0


class Admin(User):
    """A user with administrative privileges."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the admin."""
        super().__init__(first_name, last_name, username, email, location)
        
        # Initialize an empty set of privileges.
        self.privileges = Privileges()


class Privileges():
    """A class to store an admin's privileges."""

    def __init__(self, privileges=[]):
        self.privileges = privileges

    def show_privileges(self):
        print("\nPrivileges:")
        if self.privileges:
            for privilege in self.privileges:
                print(f"- {privilege}")
        else:
            print("- This user has no privileges.")


eric = Admin('eric', 'matthes', 'e_matthes', 'e_matthes@example.com', 'alaska')
eric.describe_user()

eric.privileges.show_privileges()

print("\nAdding privileges...")
eric_privileges = [
    'can reset passwords',
    'can moderate discussions',
    'can suspend accounts',
    ]
eric.privileges.privileges = eric_privileges
eric.privileges.show_privileges()
```

Output:

```
Eric Matthes
  Username: e_matthes
  Email: e_matthes@example.com
  Location: Alaska

Privileges:
- This user has no privileges.

Adding privileges...

Privileges:
- can reset passwords
- can moderate discussions
- can suspend accounts
```

## 9-9: Battery Upgrade

Use the final version of *electric_car.py* from this section. Add a method to the `Battery` class called `upgrade_battery()`. This method should check the battery size and set the capacity to 100 if it isn't already. Make an electric car with a default battery size, call `get_range()` once, and then call `get_range()` a second time after upgrading the battery. You should see an increase in the car's range.

```python
class Car():
    """A simple attempt to represent a car."""

    def __init__(self, manufacturer, model, year):

        print(f"This car has a {self.battery_size}-kWh battery.")

    def get_range(self):

        message += " miles on a full charge."
        print(message)

## 9-10: Imported Restaurant

Using your latest `Restaurant` class, store it in a module. Make a separate file that imports `Restaurant`. Make a `Restaurant` instance, and call one of `Restaurant`'s methods to show that the `import` statement is working properly.

*restaurant.py:*

```python
"""A class representing a restaurant."""

class Restaurant():
    """A class representing a restaurant."""

    def __init__(self, name, cuisine_type):
        """Initialize the restaurant."""
        self.name = name.title()
        self.cuisine_type = cuisine_type
        self.number_served = 0

    def describe_restaurant(self):
        """Display a summary of the restaurant."""
        msg = f"{self.name} serves wonderful {self.cuisine_type}."
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def open_restaurant(self):
        """Display a message that the restaurant is open."""
        msg = f"{self.name} is open. Come on in!"
        print(f"\n{msg}")

    def set_number_served(self, number_served):
        """Allow user to set the number of customers that have been served."""
        self.number_served = number_served

    def increment_number_served(self, additional_served):
        """Allow user to increment the number of customers served."""
        self.number_served += additional_served
```

*my_restaurant.py:*

```python
from restaurant import Restaurant

channel_club = Restaurant('the channel club', 'steak and seafood')
channel_club.describe_restaurant()
channel_club.open_restaurant()
```

Output:

```
The Channel Club serves wonderful steak and seafood.

The Channel Club is open. Come on in!
```

[top](#top)

## 9-11: Imported Admin

Start with your work from Exercise 9-8 (page 173). Store the classes `User`, `Privileges` and `Admin` in one module. Create a separate file, make an `Admin` instance, and call `show_priveleges()` to show that everything is working correctly.

*user.py:*

```python
"""A collection of classes for modeling users."""

class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):

## 9-12: Multiple Modules

Store the `User` class in one module, and store the `Privileges` and `Admin` classes in a separate module. In a separate file, create an `Admin` instance and call `show_privileges()` to show that everything is still working correctly.

*user.py:*

```python
"""A class for modeling users."""

class User():
    """Represent a simple user profile."""

    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, username, email, location):
        """Initialize the user."""

## 9-13: Dice

The module `random` contains functions that generate random numbers in a variety of ways. The function `randint()` returns an integer in the range you provide. the following code returns a number between 1 and 6:

```python
from random import randint
x = randint(1, 6)
```

Make a class `Die` with one attribute called `sides`, which has a default value of 6. Write a method called `roll_die()` that prints a random number between 1 and the number of sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and roll it 10 times.

Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die. Roll each die 10 times.

```python
from random import randint

class Die():
    """Represent a die, which can be rolled."""

    def __init__(self, sides=6):
        """Initialize the die."""
        self.sides = sides

    def roll_die(self):
        """Return a number between 1 and the number of sides."""
        return randint(1, self.sides)

# Make a 6-sided die, and show the results of 10 rolls.
d6 = Die()

results = []
for roll_num in range(10):
    result = d6.roll_die()
    results.append(result)
print("10 rolls of a 6-sided die:")
print(results)

# Make a 10-sided die, and show the results of 10 rolls.
d10 = Die(sides=10)

results = []
for roll_num in range(10):
    result = d10.roll_die()
    results.append(result)
print("\n10 rolls of a 10-sided die:")
print(results)

# Make a 20-sided die, and show the results of 10 rolls.
d20 = Die(sides=20)

results = []
for roll_num in range(10):
    result = d20.roll_die()
    results.append(result)
print("\n10 rolls of a 20-sided die:")
print(results)
```

Output:

```
10 rolls of a 6-sided die:
[5, 5, 6, 3, 6, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1]

10 rolls of a 10-sided die:
[8, 9, 8, 10, 7, 1, 3, 5, 3, 4]

10 rolls of a 20-sided die:
[4, 3, 18, 17, 3, 1, 13, 12, 5, 14]
```

## 9-14: Lottery

Make a list or tuple containing a series of 10 numbers and five letters. Randomly select four numbers or letters from the list and print a message saying that any ticket matching these four numbers or letters wins a prize.

```python
from random import choice

possibilities = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

winning_ticket = []
print("Let's see what the winning ticket is...")

# We don't want to repeat winning numbers or letters, so we'll use a
#   while loop.
while len(winning_ticket) < 4:
    pulled_item = choice(possibilities)

    # Only add the pulled item to the winning ticket if it hasn't
    #   already been pulled.
    if pulled_item not in winning_ticket:
        print(f"  We pulled a {pulled_item}!")
        winning_ticket.append(pulled_item)
```

Output:
```
Let's see what the winning ticket is...
  We pulled a 10!
  We pulled a a!
  We pulled a 2!
  We pulled a 4!

The final winning ticket is: [10, 'a', 2, 4]
```

## 9-15: Lottery Analysis

You can use a loop to see how hard it might be to win the kind of lottery you just modeled. Make a list or tuple called my_ticket. Write a loop that keeps pulling numbers until your ticket wins. Print a message reporting how many times the loop had to run to give you a winning ticket.

```python
from random import choice

def get_winning_ticket(possibilities):
    """Return a winning ticket from a set of possibilities."""
    winning_ticket = []

    # We don't want to repeat winning numbers or letters, so we'll use a
    #   while loop.
    while len(winning_ticket) < 4:
        pulled_item = choice(possibilities)

        # Only add the pulled item to the winning ticket if it hasn't
        #   already been pulled.
        if pulled_item not in winning_ticket:
            winning_ticket.append(pulled_item)

    return winning_ticket

def check_ticket(played_ticket, winning_ticket):
    # Check all elements in the played ticket. If any are not in the 
    #   winning ticket, return False.
    for element in played_ticket:
        if element not in winning_ticket:
            return False

    # We must have a winning ticket!
    return True

def make_random_ticket(possibilities):
    """Return a random ticket from a set of possibilities."""
    ticket = []
    # We don't want to repeat numbers or letters, so we'll use a while loop.
    while len(ticket) < 4:
        pulled_item = choice(possibilities)

        # Only add the pulled item to the ticket if it hasn't already
        #   been pulled.
        if pulled_item not in ticket:
            ticket.append(pulled_item)

    return ticket


possibilities = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
winning_ticket = get_winning_ticket(possibilities)

plays = 0
won = False

# Let's set a max number of tries, in case this takes forever!
max_tries = 1_000_000

while not won:
    new_ticket = make_random_ticket(possibilities)
    won = check_ticket(new_ticket, winning_ticket)
    plays += 1
    if plays >= max_tries:
        break

if won:
    print("We have a winning ticket!")
    print(f"Your ticket: {new_ticket}")
    print(f"Winning ticket: {winning_ticket}")
    print(f"It only took {plays} tries to win!")
else:
    print(f"Tried {plays} times, without pulling a winner. :(")
    print(f"Your ticket: {new_ticket}")
    print(f"Winning ticket: {winning_ticket}")
```

Output:
```
We have a winning ticket!
Your ticket: ['a', 8, 'b', 7]
Winning ticket: [7, 'b', 8, 'a']
It only took 408 tries to win!
```
