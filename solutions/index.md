# Solutions
{: .no_toc }

Solutions for selected exercises from each chapter can be found below. Be careful about looking at the solutions too quickly; make sure you've given yourself time to wrestle with the concepts you just learned before looking at a solution. Also, there are several ways to solve many of the exercises, and the solutions only show one possible way to complete each exercise.

The book's author hasn't included solutions for Chapters 18-20, because the exercises for those chapters are really projects in themselves. If you're having trouble with an exercise from one of those chapters consider posting on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/), or [join the <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NNTin/discord-logo/master/src/assets/animateddiscord.svg" width="26" class="email" alt="Discord logo animated" title="Join us on Discord!" />Discord server ](https://discord.gg/KzzTBbr).
