# Getting Help

Everyone gets stuck at some point when they’re learning to program, and
one of the most important skills to learn as a programmer is how to get
unstuck efficiently. This appendix outlines several ways to help you get
unstuck when programming gets confusing.

## Outline of how to get unstuck

### General Tips

The Python community is particularly friendly to newcomers &mdash; they're often
happy to help fellow Python programmers. Remember to embody that spirit
yourself when you ask for help. Be friendly (start with a warm greeting),
and grateful in response to help you receive (thank them, try it out, and let them
know if it works). Try to build a reputation as someone who is pleasant to talk to!

### **First Steps**

When you’re stuck, try to assess your problem and how you got there. Before you can
get help from anyone else, you’ll need to be able to answer the following
three questions clearly:

• What are you trying to do? ("Trying to display a star on the screen")

• What have you tried so far? (Provide a link to the GitHub repo where your work resides)

• What results have you been getting? ("I get a full pygame window filled with blue color, but no star")

Your answers should be as specific as possible. For the first question,
explicit statements like “I’m trying to install the latest version of
Python 3 on my Windows 10 machine” are detailed enough for others in the
Python community to help you. Statements like “I’m trying to install
Python” don’t provide enough information for others to offer much help.

Your answer to the second question should provide enough detail that you
won’t be advised to repeat what you’ve already tried: “I went to
*<http://python.org/downloads/>* and clicked the Download button for
Python 3. Then I ran the installer,” is more helpful than, “I went to the
Python website and downloaded an installer.”

For the final question, it’s helpful to know the exact error messages
you received when you’re searching online for a solution or when asking
for help.

Sometimes answering these three questions for yourself allows you to see
something you’re missing and get you unstuck without having to go any
further. Programmers even have a name for this: it’s called *rubber duck
debugging*. If you explain your situation to a rubber duck (or any
inanimate object) clearly, and ask it a specific question, you’ll often
be able to answer your own question. Some programming shops even keep a
real rubber duck around to encourage people to “talk to the duck.”

#### ***Try It Again***

Just going back to the start and trying again can be enough to solve
many problems. Say you’re trying to write a for loop based on an example
from this book. You might have only missed something simple, like a
colon at the end of the for line. Going through the steps again might
help you avoid repeating the same mistake.

#### ***Take a Break***

If you’ve been working on the same problem for a while, taking a break
is actually one of the best tactics you can try. When we work on the
same task for long periods of time, our brains start to zero in on only
one solution. We lose sight of the assumptions we’ve made, and taking a
break helps us get a fresh perspective on the problem. It doesn’t need
to be a long break, just something that gets you out of your current
mindset. If you’ve been sitting for a long time, do something physical:
take a short walk or go outside for a bit; maybe drink a glass of water
or eat a light and healthy snack.

If you’re getting frustrated, it might be worth putting your work away
for the day. A good night’s sleep almost always makes a problem more
approachable.

#### ***Refer to This Book’s Resources***

The online resources for this book, available through
*<https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse/>*, include a number of
helpful sections about setting up your system and working through each
chapter. If you haven’t done so already, take a look at these resources
and see if there’s anything that helps.


### Pygame Discord Server

The Pygame community provides help on their Discord server here:

https://discord.com/invite/ZuB2RySPRJ

To get started, you need to [read the server rules](https://discord.com/channels/772505616680878080/772509621747187712) and then choose "Newbie" by giving a 🟢 (`:green_circle:`) *react* to the message by Carl-Bot in the [roles-🎓](https://discord.com/channels/772505616680878080/772535163195228200) channel.

Always post or provide a link to your code when asking for help. People cannot help you if they don’t have access to your code! Introduce yourself, and thank those who respond to your question.

### **Searching Online**

Chances are that someone else has had the same problem you’re having and
has written about it online. Good searching skills and specific
inquiries will help you find existing resources to solve the issue
you’re facing. For example, if you’re struggling to install Python 3 on
Windows 10, searching *python 3 windows 10* might direct you to the
answer.

Searching the exact error message can be extremely helpful too. For
example, say you get the following error when you try to start a Python
terminal session:

    \> python  
    'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command  
    \>

Searching for the full phrase *python is not recognized as an internal
or external command* will probably yield some good advice.

When you start searching for programming-related topics, a few sites
will appear repeatedly. I’ll describe some of these sites briefly, so
you’ll know how helpful they’re likely to be.

#### ***Stack Overflow***

Stack Overflow (*<http://stackoverflow.com/>*) is one of the most
popular question-and-answer sites for programmers, and will often appear
in the first page of results on Python-related searches. Members post
questions when they’re stuck, and other members try to give helpful
responses. Users can vote for the responses they find most helpful, so
the best answers are usually the first ones you’ll find.

Many basic Python questions have very clear answers on Stack Overflow,
because the community has refined them over time. Users are encouraged
to post updates too, so responses tend to stay relatively current. At
the time of this writing, over 400,000 Python-related questions have
been answered on Stack Overflow.

#### ***The Official Python Documentation***

The official Python documentation (*<http://docs.python.org/>*) is a bit
more hit or miss for beginners, because the purpose is more to document
the language than write explanations. The examples in the official
documentation should work, but you might not understand everything
shown. Still, it’s a good resource to check when it comes up in your
searches and will become more useful to you as you continue building
your understanding of Python.

#### ***Official Library Documentation***

If you’re using a specific library, such as Pygame, matplotlib, Django,
and so on, links to the official documentation for that project will
often appear in searches—for example, *<http://docs.djangoproject.com/>*
is very helpful. If you’re planning to work with any of these libraries,
it’s a good idea to become familiar with the official documentation.

#### ***r/learnpython***

Reddit is made up of a number of subforums called *subreddits*. The
*r/learnpython* subreddit (*<http://reddit.com/r/learnpython/>*) is
fairly active and supportive. Here you can read others’ questions and
post your own.

#### ***Blog Posts***

Many programmers maintain blogs and share posts about the parts of the
language they’re working with. You should skim the first few comments on
a blog post to see what reactions other people have had before taking
any advice. If no comments appear, take the post with a grain of salt.
It’s possible no one else has verified the advice.

### **IRC (Internet Relay Chat)**

Programmers interact in real time through IRC. If you’re stuck on a
problem and searching online isn’t providing answers, asking in an IRC
channel might be your best option. Most people who hang out in these
channels are polite and helpful, especially if you can be specific about
what you’re trying to do, what you’ve already tried, and what results
you’re getting.

#### ***Make an IRC Account***

To create an account on IRC, go to *<http://webchat.freenode.net/>*.
Choose a nickname, fill out the Captcha box, and click **Connect**.
You’ll see a message welcoming you to the freenode IRC server. In the
box at the bottom of the window, enter the following command:

/msg nickserv register password email

Enter your own password and email address in place of password and
email. Choose a simple password that you don’t use for any other
account. This password is not transmitted securely, so don’t even try to
make a secure password. You’ll receive an email with instructions to
verify your account. The email will provide you with a command like
this:

/msg nickserv verify register nickname verification_code

Paste this line into the IRC site with nickname as the name you chose
earlier and a value for verification_code. Now you’re ready to join a
channel.

#### ***Channels to Join***

To join the main Python channel, enter /join #python in the input box.
You’ll see a confirmation that you joined the channel and some general
information about the channel.

The channel *##learnpython* (with two hashtags) is usually quite active
as well. This channel is associated with
*<http://reddit.com/r/learnpython/>*, so you’ll see messages about posts
on *r/learnpython* too. The *#pyladies* channel focuses on supporting
women who are learning Python, as well as people who are supportive of
women programmers. You might want to join the *#django* channel if
you’re working on web applications.

After you’ve joined a channel, you can read the conversations other
people are having and ask your own questions as well.

#### ***IRC Culture***

To get effective help, you should know a few details about IRC culture.
Focusing on the three questions at the beginning of this appendix will
definitely help guide you to a successful solution. People will be happy
to help you if you can explain precisely what you’re trying to do, what
you’ve already tried, and the exact results you’re getting. If you need
to share code or output, IRC members use external sites made for this
purpose, such as *<https://bpaste.net/+python/>*. (This is where #python
sends you to share code and output.) This keeps the channels from being
flooded with code and also makes it much easier to read the code that
people share.

Being patient will always make people more likely to help you. Ask your
question concisely, and then wait for someone to respond. Often, people
are in the middle of many conversations, but usually someone will
address you in a reasonable amount of time. If few people are in the
channel, it might take a while to get a response.
