# Reader Questions
{: .no_toc }

The author gets questions from readers on a regular basis. He says:
<blockquote>
Many of those questions are individual in nature, but many questions also come up often enough that it's worth sharing some of those answers more publicly, and in a little more depth than I can present in an email. These questions are organized by which section of the book they're most relevant to.</blockquote>

- Alien Invasion
  - [What is the role of `self` and `ai_game` in the code that creates the ship?](./reader_questions/ship_self.md/)
