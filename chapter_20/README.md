# Styling And Deploying An App

Learning Log is fully functional now, but it has no styling and runs
only on your local machine. In this chapter weâ€™ll style the project in a
simple but professional manner and then deploy it to a live server so
anyone in the world can make an account.

## TRY IT YOURSELF #1

<span id="ch20exe1"></span>**20-1. Other Forms:** We&rsquo;ve applied
Bootstrap&rsquo;s styles to the `login` and `add_topic` pages. Make similar
changes to the rest of the form-based pages: `new_entry` and
`edit_entry`, and `register`.

<span id="ch20exe2"></span>**20-2. Stylish Blog:** Use Bootstrap to
style the Blog project you created in [Chapter 19](../chapter_19/README.md#ch19).

## TRY IT YOURSELF #2

<span id="ch20exe3"></span>**20-3. Live Blog:** Deploy the Blog project
you&rsquo;ve been working on to Heroku. Make sure you set `DEBUG` to `False`
and change the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting, so your deployment is reasonably
secure.

<span id="ch20exe4"></span>**20-4. More 404s:** The
`get_object_or_404()` function should also be used in the `new_entry()`
and `edit_entry()` views. Make this change, test it by entering a URL
like *http://localhost:8000/new_entry/99999/*, and check that you see a
404 error.

<span id="ch20exe5"></span>**20-5. Extended Learning Log:** Add one
feature to Learning Log, and push the change to your live deployment.
Try a simple change, such as writing more about the project on the home
page. Then try adding a more advanced feature, such as giving users the
option of making a topic public. This would require an attribute called
`public` as part of the `Topic` model (this should be set to `False` by
default) and a form element on the new_topic page that allows the user
to change a topic from private to public. You&rsquo;d then need to migrate the
project and revise *views.py* so any topic that&rsquo;s public is visible to
unauthenticated users as well. Remember to migrate the live database
after you&rsquo;ve pushed your changes to Heroku.
