# *Challenges* and *Beyond PCC*

Hello everyone! I recently added two new sections to the online resources for Python Crash Course that you might be interested in.

## Challenges

[This section](../../challenges/challenges/) offers an expanded set of exercises and challenges that go beyond the exercises that are presented in the book. The first set of challenges focuses on [card games](../../challenges/playing_cards/). You can start these challenges as soon as you are finished Chapter 3. 

You can do any or all of the challenges; some will probably take just a few minutes, while others are full projects that you could go really deep on.

## Beyond PCC

[This section](../../beyond_pcc/beyond_pcc) offers extensions of what's presented in the book. For example there's a section on working with the [random module](../../beyond_pcc/random_functions/). This section covers a few functions that weren't critical enough to include in the book, but which you might find useful in your own projects.

There's also a section on [working with sprite sheets in Pygame](../../beyond_pcc/pygame_sprite_sheets/), which is helpful if you're building something like a card game that has many different game elements.

## Coming Soon

I'm working on a new set of challenges that focus on building your own photo filters. I've done this project with students, and they loved it. I'm also writing a section about becoming a professional programmer, which comes from numerous email and reddit conversations about making the transition to professional programming.

# Feedback

If you have questions or comments about these new sections, feel free to reply to this email. Thanks!

Eric
