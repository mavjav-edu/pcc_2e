# Python 3.8, Django 3.0, and more...

Hello everyone! Python 3.8 has been out for a couple months now, and Django 3.0 just came out last week. Here's some information you might like to know, and some additional challenges as well.

## Python 3.8

The official Python 3.8 release notes are informative, but they aren't very friendly to read if you're new to Python. Here's a [brief overview](../..//updates/python3_8/) of what you should know about the new release, and some thoughts about when to consider upgrading to the latest release.

## Django 3.0

Django 3.0 was released December 2. Almost all of the updates are for more advanced use cases. Here's a [friendly overview](../..//updates/django3_0/) of the Django release process, and how to think about upgrading.

## New Challenges: Make your own Photo Filters

I just posted a new set of challenges focused on [making your own photo filters](../..//challenges/photo_filters/). If you've ever wondered how Instagram and other photo-manipulation apps work, this set of challenges will pull back the curtain on how it's done. You can start these challenges as early as Chapter 3.

If you try any of these challenges and end up getting stuck, please ask for help. I'd love to know what parts people are able to complete, and which parts are more difficult. If you're successful please share your images, and consider posting them with the hashtag [#pcc-photo-filter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/pcc_photo_filter). I'm really curious to see what kinds of effects people are able to create.

## Beyond PCC: Working with Images

The Pillow library lets you manipulate image files with Python. Here's a brief introduction to [getting started with Pillow](../..//beyond_pcc/pillow/), which will help you complete some of the more interesting photo filter challenges.

## Coming Soon

I'm working on a section about becoming a professional programmer, which comes from numerous email and reddit conversations about making the transition to professional programming.

## Feedback

If you have questions or comments about these new sections, feel free to reply to this email. Thanks!

Eric

## *Photo Filter Challenge*

Can you convert this image of our local bears to black and white? Can you write a function that highlights the red in their fur?
