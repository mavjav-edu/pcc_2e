In this chapter you’ll run your first Python program, *hello_world.py*.
First, you’ll need to check whether Python is installed on your
computer; if it isn’t, you’ll install it. You’ll also install a text
editor to work with your Python programs. Text editors recognize Python
code and highlight sections as you write, making it easy to understand
the structure of your code.

## TRY IT YOURSELF #1

The exercises in this chapter are exploratory in nature. Starting in
[Chapter 2](../chapter_02/tiy.md), the challenges you&rsquo;ll solve will be based
on what you&rsquo;ve learned.

<span id="ch1exe1"></span>**1-1. python.org:** Explore the Python home
page (*<http://python.org/>*) to find topics that interest you. As you
become familiar with Python, different parts of the site will be more
useful to you.

<span id="ch1exe2"></span>**1-2. Hello World Typos:** Open the
*hello_world.py* file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the
line and run the program again. Can you make a typo that generates an
error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you make a typo that
doesn&rsquo;t generate an error? Why do you think it didn&rsquo;t make an error?

<span id="ch1exe3"></span>**1-3. Infinite Skills:** If you had infinite
programming skills, what would you build? You&rsquo;re about to learn how to
program. If you have an end goal in mind, you&rsquo;ll have an immediate use
for your new skills; now is a great time to draft descriptions of what
you&rsquo;d like to create. It&rsquo;s a good habit to keep an &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; notebook that
you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take a few
minutes now to describe three programs you&rsquo;d like to create.
