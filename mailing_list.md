## E-mailing list

If you'd like to know when more resources become available, you can sign up for [email notifications here](https://emailoctopus.com/lists/95c27296-f1d4-11e9-be00-06b4694bee2a/forms/subscribe).

The book's author sends out notifications when there are significant new resources available, such as new cheat sheets, new sets of challenges, and critical updates to the projects. The author says he doesn't send emails often, and you can unsubscribe at any time.
