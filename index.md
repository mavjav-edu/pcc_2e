## <a id="source_code"></a>Downloading source code

Students will be assigned chapters from this book using [GitHub classroom]({{ 'https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/49895023-python-with-mavi' | relative_url }}). <img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/68187?s=120" alt="GitHub classroom logo is a graphic of the GitHub logo imposed on a chalkboard" title="GitHub Classroom" width="120px"/>

If you are not a student, a direct way to get these online resources is to download as a ZIP file.

<span class="fs-6">
[Download ZIP](https://github.com/mavjav-edu/pcc_2e/archive/master.zip){: .btn .btn-purple }
</span>

Click on the button above, which will download the source code files (and other resources) for the entire book.

A more flexible way is to [fork this repository and clone it]({{ 'https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/' | relative_url }}) to your local computer using `git`.

## [Cheat Sheets](./cheat_sheets/index.md)

Cheat sheets can be really helpful when you're working on a set of programming exercises or a project. This set of [cheat sheets](./cheat_sheets/index.md) will help remind you of the concepts you're learning, as well as the Python syntax for these concepts.

## [Updates](./updates/index.md)

Some of the [PyPI]({{ 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index' | relative_url }}) libraries featured in the book have been updated recently, which is a good thing &mdash; it means that the Python packages you're learning to use are being steadily improved.

When packages are updated you have the option of using the version that was featured in the book, which lets you run code exactly as it's written in the book. You can also choose to install the latest version of each package, and modify the code in the book slightly. Each approach is outlined clearly in these updates.

A list of updates is kept [here](./updates/index.md).
