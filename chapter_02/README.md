# Variables And Simple Data Types

In this chapter you’ll learn about the different kinds of data you can
work with in your Python programs. You’ll also learn how to store your
data in variables and how to use those variables in your programs.

## TRY IT YOURSELF #1

Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises. Save
each program with a filename that follows standard Python conventions,
using lowercase letters and underscores, such as *simple_message.py* and
*simple_messages.py*.

<span id="ch2exe1"></span>**2-1. Simple Message:** Store a message in a
variable, and then print that message.

<span id="ch2exe2"></span>**2-2. Simple Messages:** Store a message in a
variable, and print that message. Then change the value of your variable
to a new message, and print the new message.

## TRY IT YOURSELF #2

Save each of the following exercises as a separate file with a name like
*name_cases.py*. If you get stuck, take a break or see the suggestions
in [Appendix C](app03.html#app03).

<span id="ch2exe3"></span>**2-3. Personal Message:** Store a person&rsquo;s
name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message
should be simple, such as, &ldquo;Hello Eric, would you like to learn some
Python today?&rdquo;

<span id="ch2exe4"></span>**2-4. Name Cases:** Store a person&rsquo;s name in
a variable, and then print that person&rsquo;s name in lowercase, uppercase,
and titlecase.

<span id="ch2exe5"></span>**2-5. Famous Quote:** Find a quote from a
famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author.
Your output should look something like the following, including the
quotation marks:

*Albert Einstein once said, &ldquo;A person who never made a mistake never
tried anything new.&rdquo;*

<span id="ch2exe6"></span>**2-6. Famous Quote 2:** Repeat [Exercise
2-5](../chapter_02/README.md#ch2exe5), but this time store the famous person&rsquo;s name in
a variable called `famous_person`. Then compose your message and store
it in a new variable called `message`. Print your message.

<span id="ch2exe7"></span>**2-7. Stripping Names:** Store a person&rsquo;s
name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of
the name. Make sure you use each character combination, `"\t"` and
`"\n"`, at least once.

Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions,
`lstrip()`, `rstrip()`, and `strip()`.



<span id="page_33"></span>
## TRY IT YOURSELF #3

<span id="ch2exe8"></span>**2-8. Number Eight:** Write addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in
the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations in `print` statements
to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:

``` python
print(5 + 3)
```

Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once
on each line.

<span id="ch2exe9"></span>**2-9. Favorite Number:** Store your favorite
number in a variable. Then, using that variable, create a message that
reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

## TRY IT YOURSELF #4

<span id="ch2exe10"></span>**2-10. Adding Comments:** Choose two of the
programs you&rsquo;ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you
don&rsquo;t have anything specific to write because your programs are too
simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top
of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the
program does.

## TRY IT YOURSELF #5

<span id="ch2exe11"></span>**2-11. Zen of Python:** Enter `import this`
into a Python terminal session and skim through the additional
principles.
